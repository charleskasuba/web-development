what is html and css


HTML is the standard markup language for Web pages.

With HTML you can create your own Website.

HTML is easy to learn - You will enjoy it


 HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are two fundamental technologies used to build websites and web applications.

HTML:

HTML is a markup language used to structure and organize content on the web. It's responsible for:

1. Defining the structure and layout of web pages
2. Creating headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, tables, etc.
3. Providing semantic meaning to content (e.g., indicating headings, paragraphs, etc.)



HTML is the skeleton of all web pages. It‚Äôs often the first language learned by developers, marketers, and designers and is core to front-end development work. If this is your first time touching code, we‚Äôre excited for what you‚Äôre about to create.

So what exactly is HTML? HTML provides structure to the content appearing on a website, such as

, text, or

videos
. Right-click on any page on the internet, choose ‚ÄúInspect,‚Äù and you‚Äôll see HTML in a panel of your screen.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language:

A markup language is a computer language that defines the structure and presentation of raw text.
In HTML, the computer can interpret raw text that is wrapped in HTML

elements
.
HyperText is text displayed on a computer or device that provides access to other text through

links
, also known as hyperlinks. You probably clicked on a couple of hyperlinks on your way to this Codecademy course.
Learning HTML is the first step in creating websites, but even a bit of knowledge can help you inject code snippets into newsletter, blog or website templates. As you continue learning, you can layer HTML with CSS and JavaScript to create visually compelling and dynamic websites. But for now, we‚Äôre going to focus on how to add and modify basic content on a page, like text, images, and videos. Don‚Äôt worry if the websites look ugly ‚Äî we‚Äôre just getting started.
Basic HTML concepts:

1. Tags (e.g., <p>, <img>, <a>)
2. Elements (e.g., paragraphs, images, links)
3. Attributes (e.g., src, href, alt)

Example HTML code:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>This is my web page.</p>
  <img src="image.jpg" alt="My Image">
</body>
</html>



or


<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>




CSS:

CSS is a styling language used to control the layout, appearance, and behavior of web pages. It's responsible for:

1. Setting colors, fonts, and spacing
2. Creating layouts and positioning elements
3. Adding visual effects and animations
4. Responding to different screen sizes and devices

Basic CSS concepts:

1. Selectors (e.g., h1, .class, #id)
2. Properties (e.g., color, font-size, margin)
3. Values (e.g., red, 18px, 10%)

Example CSS code:

body {
  background-color: #f2f2f2;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
}

h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 36px;
}

img {
  width: 50%;
  margin: 20px;
}


Relationship between HTML and CSS:

HTML provides the structure, while CSS enhances the visual presentation. Think of HTML as the skeleton and CSS as the skin.

When combined, HTML and CSS create a visually appealing and functional web page.

CSS is the language we use to style an HTML document.

CSS describes how HTML elements should be displayed.

Key benefits:

1. Separation of concerns (structure vs. style)
2. Reusability and maintainability
3. Improved accessibility and user experience
4. Enhanced visual design and layout control

Real-world applications:

1. Web development
2. Mobile app development
3. Email template design
4. Digital publishing
5. Game development
