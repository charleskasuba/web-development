**HTML Overview and Summary**

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to structure content on the web. It defines the layout and presentation of text, images, multimedia, and other content. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, HTML has evolved over time, with its first version released in 1993 and the widely used HTML 5 being finalized in 2014.

### Basic HTML Structure
An HTML document is made up of several essential tags:
- **`<!DOCTYPE html>`**: Defines the document type as HTML.
- **`<html>`**: Parent tag for the entire document.
- **`<head>`**: Contains metadata and non-visible elements like the title.
- **`<title>`**: Sets the title displayed in the browser tab.
- **`<body>`**: Contains the visible content of the webpage (headings, paragraphs, etc.).
- **`<h1>`**: Defines the main heading of the page.
- **`<p>`**: Defines a paragraph of text.

### Example: Hello World in HTML
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
   <title>Hello World Example</title>
</head>
<body>
   <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
This simple code displays "Hello, World!" as a top-level heading.

### Comments in HTML
Comments in HTML are written between `<!--` and `-->` and do not display on the webpage:
```html
<!-- This is a comment -->
```
