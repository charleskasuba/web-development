What is HTML?
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is a standard markup language to design the structure of a webpage. HTML is the combination of HyperText and Markup Language. HyperText defines the internal links between webpages, and Markup language defines the layout and presentation of text and media.


Basic HTML Structure
The basic structure of an HTML document contains the few mandatory tags, that must be used to create a webpage. This structure must be followed to create any type of HTML document.



Here is the basic structure of an HTML document −


                                                                                
                                                             Open Compiler
                                                        <!DOCTYPE html>
                                                           <html>
                                                           <head>
                                                        <title>Page title</title>
                                                          </head>
                                                               <body>
                                                        <h1>Webpage's Heading</h1>
                                                  <p>Content (Your first paragraph).</p>
                                                                </body>
                                                                </html>








Elements of HTML Basic Structure
The following are the basic tags that define the basic HTML structure −

1. <!DOCTYPE html>
This element defines the document type as HTML. This element must be written before writing any HTML document.

2. <html>...</html>
The <html> tag is the parent tag for all HTML elements. Everything related to create an HTML document must be written inside the <html> tag. CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery must also be written inside this tag.

3. <head>...</head>
The <head> tag is a container tag for all those elements that are not directly displayed on the webpage but required for the page functionalities. It contains meta tags (which are used for SEO purposes), title tag, script tags, etc.

4. <title>...</title>
The <title> tag is used to define the title of the webpage that you can see in the browser's tab, bookmarks list, and search engine results. This tag is also very important for SEO purposes to help search engine to understand the content of the webpage.

5. <body>...<body>
The <body> tag is the container tag for all those elements, which represents the main content of a webpage that displays on the browser.

6. <h1>...</h1>
The <h1> tag is one of the heading tags. It is the most important heading tag, which defines the main title or headline of the webpage. Any text written inside <h1> and </h1> is a top-level heading of the content.

7. <p>...</p>
The <p> tag defines a paragraph, anything written inside <p> and </p> displays as a paragraph on the webpage. Use multiple <p> tags to display text in different paragraphs.


Writing Hello World in HTML
By using the above basic HTML structure, we can write an HTML document to display "Hello World" on the webpage.

Below is the HTML code to display Hello World on the webpage in a paragraph −



                                                       Open Compiler
                                                      <!DOCTYPE html>
                                                           <html>
                                                             <head>
                                              <title>Hello World Example by TutorialsPoint</title>
                                                               </head>
                                                                 <body>
                                                          <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
                                                             </body>
                                                                 </html>
                                                               </pre>
The above example will display "Hello, World!" on the browser inside top-level heading (h1).

Comments in HTML
Just like other programming languages, you can keep any text as a comment inside an HTML document. To create a comment in HTML, use <!-- and -->.

Any text written inside <!-- and --> considers as comment and it does not display on the website.

Example
Below is the example of HTML comment −

<!--<h1>Hello World Example</h1>-->




Open Compiler
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Online HTML Editor</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Online HTML Editor</h1>
    <p>Hello World</p>
</body>
</html>






Creating an HTML Document
An HTML document is a file containing HTML code with the ".htm" or ".html" extension. To create an HTML document, you need a text editor. And, to display it, you need a Web browser.

The steps to create an HTML document are as follows −

Open a text editor.
Write HTML code.
Save the file with the ".htm" or ".html" extension.
And, finally, open the file in the browser by typing the file name with a complete path, or just open it by right-clicking and opening with a browser.

10. What are HTML Components?
HTML components, also known as HTML elements, are the building blocks of HTML pages. They represent parts of a webpage and are defined by HTML tags. Here are some of the main components −

DOCTYPE Declaration − An HTML document starts with a <!DOCTYPE html> declaration followed by a <html> tag.
Headings − HTML provides six levels of headings from <h1> to <h6>, with <h1> being the highest (or most important) level and <h6> the lowest.
Paragraphs − The <p> tag defines a paragraph.
Links − The <a> tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another.
Images − The <img> tag is used to embed images in an HTML page.
Lists − HTML supports ordered, unordered, and definition lists.
Tables − The <table> tag defines a table in HTML.
Forms − The <form> tag is used to create an HTML form for user input.
Divisions & Sections − The <div> tag is a container unit that encapsulates other page elements and divides the HTML document into sections. HTML5 introduced semantic elements like <section>, <article>, <header>, <footer>, <nav>, etc., which serve a similar purpose but provide additional semantic information.
Media Elements − HTML5 introduced media elements like <video> and <audio> which can be used to embed video and audio files in an HTML document.
