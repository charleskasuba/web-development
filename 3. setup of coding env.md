Visual Studio Code on Windows
Installation
Download the Visual Studio Code installer for Windows.
Once it is downloaded, run the installer (VSCodeUserSetup-{version}.exe). This will only take a minute.



Install and Setup VSCode
Preface/Explanation
VSCode is the text-editor that we support in this class for editing files. We recommend VSCode because it is a feature-rich text editor that has a wide array of different community-made extensions that we use in this course that add useful features to the editor.

Steps
Download and run the VSCode installation from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/

First, we will download the required Javascript tools and language support through the welcome page

By default, VS Code is installed under C:\Users\{Username}\AppData\Local\Programs\Microsoft VS Code.
Alternatively, you can also download a Zip archive, extract it and run Code from there.

Tip: Setup will add Visual Studio Code to your %PATH%, so from the console you can type 'code .' to open VS Code on that folder. You will need to restart your console after the installation for the change to the %PATH% environmental variable to take effect.

steps to install and set up Visual Studio Code:

Go to the Visual Studio Code website and download the installer for your operating system.Here


Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install VS Code.
After installation, open VS Code from your system's application launcher.
Customize VS Code by installing extensions for programming languages, themes, and tools.
Configure Git within VS Code or install a Git extension for version control.
Customize your preferences and settings by accessing the "Settings" option.
Start a new project or open an existing one by selecting a folder.
Begin coding, use integrated terminal, and run your programs from VS Code.
Utilize the debugging features by adding breakpoints and running your code in debug mode
User setup versus system setup
VS Code provides both Windows user and system level setups.

The user setup does not require Administrator privileges to run as the location will be under your user Local AppData (LOCALAPPDATA) folder. Since it requires no elevation, the user setup is able to provide a smoother background update experience. This is the preferred way to install VS Code on Windows.

Note: When running VS Code as Administrator in a user setup installation, updates will be disabled.

The system setup requires elevation to Administrator privileges to run and will place the installation under the system's Program Files. The in-product update flow will also require elevation, making it less streamlined than the user setup. On the other hand, installing VS Code using the system setup means that it will be available to all users in the system.

See the Download Visual Studio Code page for a complete list of available installation options.

Updates
VS Code ships monthly releases and supports auto-update when a new release is available. If you're prompted by VS Code, accept the newest update and it will be installed (you won't need to do anything else to get the latest bits).

Note: You can disable auto-update if you prefer to update VS Code on your own schedule.
